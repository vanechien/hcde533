                STEP 1: ASSEMBLE
                <br> ------
                <br> Assembly for this printer took about 2 hours. I found the instructions a bit confusing, but manageable
                <br> (thank you IKEA for the experience with confusing furniture assembly instructions!)
                <br> Overall, I didn't have too much trouble, but I did have to unscrew pieces a couple times because I kept getting the cables on the wrong sides.
                <br> After connecting all the cables, I was ready to level the bed!

            </p>
            <p>
                STEP 2: LEVELING THE BED.
                <br> ------
                <br> Next, I did the leveling procedure for the bed! I had quite a bit of trouble at first because the back left corner was way too close to the nozzle.
                <br> After doing some online searching, I read that this is a pretty common issue! So I raised the z axis stopper slightly, giving me more wiggle room.
                <br> I printed the squares to check how well it was leveled (not pictured) and after some tweaks, I made another bed level test I found online.

            <p>
                STEP 3: TIME TO PRINT GEOMETRIC SHAPES!
                <br> ------
                <br> Here's a quick overview of my STL models:
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                The cube prints were pretty straightforward. I printed low, standard, and super qualities, as well as the concentric setting.
                <br> Next, I printed the tubes, with single extrusion (0.4mm) and double extusion (0.8mm) walls.
                <br> Feeling a little more confident, I attempted to print 3 of the cylinders in one print. Even though they printed okay, I noticed a wonky waving on the side of the cylinders.
                <br> I also added small extruded labels to indicate 0.1mm and 0.001mm tolerance.

            </p>
            <p> 
                Here are all my geometric prints in one picture! I also recorded the sizes with my caliper (see chart below). Overall, the measurements were surprisingly accurate!

            </p>

            <p>
                STEP 4: PRINTING NESTED SHAPES
                <br> ------
                <br> For my nested shapes, I wanted switch it up and try printing some organic shapes. I had no idea how to do this in Rhino, so here are some tutorials I watched:
                <br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=texTjIt6-00"> Organic Vase Rhino Tutorial </a>
            <br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5afsQYe9apE"> Cookie Cutter Rhino Tutorial </a>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                After playing around on Rhino, I was able to create a model of the organic shapes in their nested form. However, I kept getting an error on Cura saying I had "missing or extraneous surfaces."
            </p>
            <p> 
                <img src="Assignment 3.7.png" width=800></a>
            </p>

                <br> After some struggle I realized it's because I needed some thickness in my extrusion, and extruding only lines always resulted in an error.
                <br> Once I learned to fix that, it worked! Here's the preview on Cura:

            <p>
                Final result was just as I hoped, except for a bulging layer that I'm still troubleshooting:

            </p>
