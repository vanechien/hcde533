            <h1>Assignment 7: Final Project Proposal</h1>
            <p>By Vanessa Chien Lai - HCDE 533
                 
            <p> For my final project, I want to create a custom macro keypad. Macropads are basically mini keyboards that can be programmed to perform shortcuts (macros).
                <br> I really like mechanical keyboards, and felt like this could be a really good way to learn how to (1) handwire my own and (2) solder!
                <br> I plan to create a 2x4 macropad (8 keys), and program it to perform useful shortcuts, like copy + paste, a "panic" switch, mute, and Figma shortcuts.
            </p>

              Here are some pictures for inspiration (and for reference if you haven't seen these before)

            <p>
              <br> METHODS AND TECHNIQUES USED
                <br> ------
                <br>  1. Rhino3D (macropad casing and laser cut shape)
                <br>  2. 3D printing (macropad casing)
                <br>  3. Laser cutting (top and bottom plates)
                <br>  4. Mold design and casting (resin keycaps)
                <br>  5. Incorporating stock parts (Arduino Pro Micro, Cherry MX blues)
            </p>
            <p>
              <br> MATERIALS
                <br> ------
                <br> Here's the full list of materials, all of which have been sourced. Other tools and machines not listed are:
                <br> 3D printer,  caliper, wire cutters, cutting knife, wire stripper and soldering iron (from the MILL)

            </p>
            <p>
                <br> SCHEDULE & CONTIINGENCY PLANS
                <br> ------
                <br> • Nov. 18 ~ 20: planning and sketching
                <br> • Nov. 21 ~ 27: 3D modeling, 3D printing, and testing
                <br> • Nov. 28 ~ Dec. 2: Laser cutting and soldering
                <br> • Dec. 3 ~ 6: Programming, final assembly, documentation 
                <br> Below are the contingency plans:
                <br> • If the laser cutters are down, I will 3D print the top and bottom plates instead, and use stock parts to attach them together.
                <br> • In case of complications with soldering, programming, or faulty stock parts, I will submit a final piece that is fully assembled but with limited functionality (i.e. no specialized shortcuts)
