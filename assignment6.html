            <h1>Assignment 6: Molding & Casting Part 2!</h1>
            <p>By Vanessa Chien Lai - HCDE 533
                 
                <br> Here's a quick recap of the things I did for part 1 of the assignment:
            <p>
                <br> STEP 1: SKETCHING & PLANNING
                <br> ------
                <br> For this assignment, I wanted to do a simple shape so that I could focus on learning the proper mold design techniques.
                <br> I decided to make a little round ring dish, with a dip in the middle (kind of looks like a red blood cell?)

            </p>
            <p>
              <br> STEP 2: MODELING & RENDERING
                <br> ------
                <br> I began with a super simple curve, and used the Revolve function to revolve it around the Y axis.
                <br> This created my master part. It looked pretty good!
            <p>

            </p>
             <p>
                <br> Next, I added some registration marks, a funnel, and a plane to cut the shapes in two halves of the mold.
                <br> Using the BooleanSplit command, I split all the shapes and then moved them aside.
            <p>

                <br> <img src="Assignment 6.7.png" width=800></a>
            </p>
            <p>
                <br> I then used BooleanDifference to make the "holes" for the registration marks, and finally, BooleanUnioin to merge everything together.
                <br> For the container, I made only the walls, and created this tapered edge to account for any printing discrepancies.
                <br> I figured that having this type of edge might help me demold my silicone more easily as well!
            <p>
                <br> Here are all my parts, rendered:

            </p> 
                <br> STEP 3: PRINTING & SILICONE CASTING
                <br> ------
                <br> Printing took WAY longer than I anticipated: 5 hours for the bottom half, 6 for the top, and another 4 for the container.
                <br> I did some light sanding, and it was ready for silicone.

               ------PART 2 OF THE ASSIGNMENT--------
            <br> For the hydrostone casting portion, I wanted to try recreating a terrazzo effect. Because I was unfamiliar with the propoerties of hydrostone (and my own mold), I tried casting a regular piece first.
            <br> Because my mold was thin and wide, I tried using some pens and rubber bands to keep the mold sandwiched together. It worked pretty well!
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
              For the terrazzo dish, I first tinted some hydrostone using different acrylic paints, and spread each in a thin layer on aluminum foil.
              <br> After curing, I crushed the colors into little terrazzo "chips" and mixed them in a container.
              <br> Lastly, I mixed up hydrostone powder with water, and gradually added the terrazzo chips and poured it into the container.
              <br> My first terrazzo piece came out well, but I ran our of hydrostone at the end, which ended up making me add too much water.

            </p>
            <p>
            Here are all my pieces together! 3/4 of them actually ended up looking pretty nice.
