            From the start, I envisioned two different kinds of pieces: "nodes" and "connectors", reminiscent of the construction games I used to play with when I was a kid.
                <br> I started doing a quick and dirty prototype using a La Croix box I had, which already had perfect circles imprinted from the cans (thanks La Croix!) 
                <br> I also made some parallelograms and made cuts perpendicular to the edges, and made a neat little construction.
