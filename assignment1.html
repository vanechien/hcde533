            <h1>Assignment 1: Modeling and Laser Cutting</h1>

                <br> Quick preview of my final construction kit!

                From the start, I envisioned two different kinds of pieces: "nodes" and "connectors", reminiscent of the construction games I used to play with when I was a kid.
                <br> I started doing a quick and dirty prototype using a La Croix box I had, which already had perfect circles imprinted from the cans (thanks La Croix!) 
                <br> I also made some parallelograms and made cuts perpendicular to the edges, and made a neat little construction.

            </p>
            <p>
                Because my La Croix circles were a little too big, I decided to make them just a bit smaller and go with a diameter of 40mm.
                <br> Then, I created my circles and parallelograms in Rhino, with notches that were just a tad thinner than the width of my cardboard.
                <br> I created shapes and then made rectangles for the notches, and used the CurveBoolean command to isolate the shape I wanted.

            </p>
            <p>
                I struggled a bit to get the circles the right size, but the fit was great on the first try!
                <br> My parallelograms failed on the first try because I forgot to cut perpendicular to the edge, but second time's the charm.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
                My final pieces came together just like the prototype! I used my failed parallelograms to add little feet to the structure.
                <br> My notches ended up being 2mm wide for 2.5mm cardboard.
