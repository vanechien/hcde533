                STEP 1: DEMO, LEARNING, TESTING
                <br> ------
                <br> This week, we had a very involved demo during class which I really appreciated. I'm a hands-on learner, and Junchao's demo was really helpful!
                <br> We were able to see how the mill worked up close, and even milled (or attempted to mill) a square. 
                <br> Within 5 seconds the FR1 layer came off, along with the sacrificial layer... that's how we learned that the WHOLE surface needs double sided tape.
                <br> After testing it out I was ready to try it on my own!

                STEP 2: PLANNING & MODELING
                <br> ------
                <br> Next, I used my caliper to measure the thickness of the FR1 board and got 1.4mm.
                <br> Because I didn't want my finger joints to stick out, I chose to make the slots only 1mm deep. 
                <br> Junchao mentioned that we needed to leave some wiggle room for the finger joints, so I made the joints 6.7mm and the slots 7mm (this was just a guesstimate).
                <br> I also added dogbones of 1mm in diameter, and a cute little bear for the engraving.
                <br> For unknown reasons, any shapes that were mirrored in Rhino were showing up wrong on KiCAD so I had to tweak my file a few times.
                <br> As instructed, I set my box cutting lines as Edge_Cuts and the bear as User_Drawings.

            </p>
            <p>
                STEP 3: TIME TO MILL!
                <br> ------
                <br> I struggled for a long time to get my GRB to look right on Bantam. For some reason, the bear kept getting distorted, and the face ended up shrinking.
                <br> It turned into this little mole that was actually quite cute. I decided to keep it :)

            </p>
            <p>
                Here were the settings I used on the Bantam software:
                <br> Material size - 100mm x 70mm x 1.4mm (FR1 thickness)
                <br> Z-offset - 1.4mm (sacrificial layer, including double sided tape)
                <br> I also added a 5mm x 5mm offset so that the design wouldn't cut so close to the edge.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <img src="Assignment 4.5.png" width=1000></a>
            </p>
            <p> 
                Attempt #1 cutting went smooth, but the pieces just would not fit together (and I did not want to sand them).
                <br> I went back to my Rhino file and trimmed the finger joints a bit more, making them 6.5mm for the 7mm slot.
                <br> I was able to fit the pieces together on Attempt #2! However, I learned that this material is very rigid and unforgiving.
                <br> My finger joint box was a little loose, which means I probably should have gone with 6.6mm. Oh well, good experience for next time.
                <br> Here's the messy aftermath and some progress pics:

            </p>
            <p>
                <br> Here's the final result! Bear-that-looks-like-a-monkey Finger Joint Box!
