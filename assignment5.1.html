            </p>
            <p>
              Quick preview of the lamp I made:

            </p>
            <p>
                Here's a quick recap of the things I did for part 1 of the assignment:
                <br> ------
                <br> PART 1: SKETCHING & PLANNING
                <br> I made a quick sketch of the vision I had before I began modeling and printing.

            </p>
            <p>
                PART 2: MODELING
                <br> ------
                <br> I modeled my voronoi spheres using grasshopper, making changes to the voronoi cells as needed.
            </p>

            </p>
                STEP 3: SLICING & PRINTING
                <br> ------
                <br> For this print, I thought it might be smart to use "tree branch" supports, beacuse it's such a complex shape.
                <br> I thought the branches could reach in through the nooks and crannies and help support the top of the sphere, which I was worried would cave in.
                <br> 
            </p>
            <p>
                <img src="Assignment 5.15.png" width=800></a>
               
            </p>
            <p> In order to pause the print halfway and add my candle, I had to add a Post Processing Script.
                <br> I learned that this is a command that interrupts the G code to tell the printer to pause.
                <br> I asked the printer to pause after finishing layer #218, which based on the preview I guesstimated would be tell enough to hold my candle.
                <br> I also told the nozzle to move out of the way (to coordinate 0, 230) and maintain a standby temp of 180 so that I would be able to add the candle in.
            <p>
            <p>

              <br> now for part 2...
            </p>
            <p>
                STEP 4: LAMP "FIXTURE" & FINAL ASSEMBLY
                <br> ------
                <br> After making 10 of these spheres, it was time to make the part that would hold them up.
                <br> I measured the diameter of the part where I was going to insert this piece, and modeled a simple shape in Rhino.
            </p> 
            <p> 
                <img src="Assignment 6.1.png" width=800></a>
            </p>
            <p>
              <br> The print was successful, and the piece stuck together pretty easily, with the help of some tension from the lamp innards.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
              <br> After tying each sphere with some nylon string and adjusting the lengths, here's the final result!
            </p>

                ------------------------ MOLDING & CASTING PART 1 -------------------------------------------
           </p>
           <p>
                <br> STEP 1: SKETCHING & PLANNING
                <br> ------
                <br> For this assignment, I wanted to do a simple shape so that I could focus on learning the proper mold design techniques.
                <br> I decided to make a little round ring dish, with a dip in the middle (kind of looks like a red blood cell?)
                <br> Picturing how the mold-for-a-mold would fit together was making my brain hurt, so I made a sketch.
                <br> I purposely drew one of the mold halves upside down, so that I could picture how the final silicone pieces would fit together.
                <br> I decided to make 4 registration marks as well as a funnel to pour the HydroStone in later.
            </p>
            <p> 
                <img src="Assignment 6.4.png" width=900></a>
            </p>
            <p>
              <br> STEP 2: MODELING & RENDERING
                <br> ------
                <br> I began with a super simple curve, and used the Revolve function to revolve it around the Y axis.
                <br> This created my master part. It looked pretty good!
            <p>
                <img src="Assignment 6.5.png" width=1000></a>
            </p>
             <p>
                <br> Next, I added some registration marks, a funnel, and a plane to cut the shapes in two halves of the mold.
                <br> Using the BooleanSplit command, I split all the shapes and then moved them aside.
            <p>
                <img src="Assignment 6.6.png" width=800></a>
                <br> <img src="Assignment 6.7.png" width=800></a>
            </p>
            <p>
                <br> I then used BooleanDifference to make the "holes" for the registration marks, and finally, BooleanUnioin to merge everything together.
                <br> For the container, I made only the walls, and created this tapered edge to account for any printing discrepancies.
                <br> I figured that having this type of edge might help me demold my silicone more easily as well!
            <p>

                <br> <img src="Assignment 6.9.png" width=1000></a>
            </p>
            <p>
                <br> Here are all my parts, rendered:

            </p> 
                <br> STEP 3: PRINTING & SILICONE CASTING
                <br> ------
                <br> Printing took WAY longer than I anticipated: 5 hours for the bottom half, 6 for the top, and another 4 for the container.
                <br> I did some light sanding, and it was ready for silicone.
            </p>
            <p>
                I used this rice trick in order to guesstimate how much silicone I needed in volume. I poured it into two cups, and determined how much I needed.
                <br> For this project, I decided to use Mold Star 30 because of it's higher tensile strength.
                <br> I read that this would be good for resin casting, which I plan to do for my final project.
                <br> I decided to layer some plastic wrap in between the container and the shape mold, just in case the silicone leaked through.
                <br> It ended up being a container - plastic wrap - shape mold - silicone sandwich!
                <br> Following the instructions, I measured 100:96 for the A:B ratio by weight.
            <p>
            <p>
                <br> Demolding was pretty easy the first time, but the second time I demolded too early and caused some damage to the edges of the silicone.
                <br> Fortunately, the essential parts of the mold remained intact and the molds fit well!
            <p>

            </p> 
            <p>
                <br> Next week, I plan to cast 4 of these ring dishes in hydrostone, and plan to use some dye to tint it in different colors.
