                STEP 1: DESIGN!
                <br> For this assignment, I wanted to use the parametric modeling in Grasshopper to come up with different polygons with a variation of cuts.
                <br> I was really inspired by some of the examples we saw in class, and decided to try cuts of different angles to see what kind of 3D shape I could come up with. 
                <br> Ultimately, I came up with four polygons, each with rounded corners (radius of 5). I used the polygon component and used parametric inputs to determine the number of sides.
                <br> Other inputs I had were Y height of the rectangle (12), width (described below), as well as inputs for the move function, which was set to (width/-2) for the X movement and (radius-height) for the Y movement.

            <p>
                STEP 2: SET CARDBOARD WIDTH & ARRAYS.
                <br> For my cardboard cuts, I used an array component to vary the number of cuts I had on each polygon.
                <br> For my cardboard, I decided to make the cuts a bit thinner than the width of the cardboard (based on my experience with assignment 1).
                <br> I made the width of the cuts 4.8.

            <p>
                STEP: PRINT!
                <br> It was my first time using the laser cutter at the 8, so the settings were new to me and looked a little different form the ones at the MILL.
                <br> My first attempt at cutting resulted in a small fire (oops) which I was able to quickly put out.

            </p>
            <p>
                My final pieces came together without a hitch!
                <br> I was able to make a lot of different structures with the 4 shapes I cut.
                <br> ------
                <br> Laser cutter settings:
                <br> 5% speed
                <br> 37% power
                <br> 310 PPI
                <br> ------
                <br> A couple more pics (look how clean these cuts turned out!) including the small fire incident...
